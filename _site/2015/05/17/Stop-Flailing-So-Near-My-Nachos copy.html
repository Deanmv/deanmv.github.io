    <p>Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun ddddun dun dun! Didn’t hear that classic tune once at the baseball. It was great fun though, minus the horrific thunderstorm that almost called off the game. Found someones phone (very wet) and like the good people we are we handed it to him. I ate several hot dogs and shared cheesesteak nachos :D One thing I did notice is that the Americans seem to have limited attention span. Literally after one bat, they’re up again getting more food, drinks, swapping seats and being generally annoying. One family in front of us came with their two sons and a baby that couldn’t have been more than a week old!! She was tiny! Amazingly, she slept through the whole thing.</p>

<p>This morning we left Philly and drove to JFK to hand back Mitch :( It was a sad time, we’d gotten so used to driving Mitch and being a trusty Ford he was a good car to drive! Dean’s wanting to buy a new one for our dog… which we both know won’t fit in a Mustang. After a little stress handing the car back, sorting paperwork and an hour and a half drive to in the taxi through traffic, we were finally here! The Cassa hotel is a very new hotel and it’s in a good spot for us. It’s walking distance to Times Square and it has a two roof top terraces.</p>

<p>We went to Bubba Gump shrimp for dinner and only had a short wait considering it was 7pm and a weekend in Times Square. We had cocktails and a lush dinner :) The waiter came round and quizzed us on our Forrest Gump knowledge, he was disappointed to hear I’d never seen it!!</p>

<p>After dinner we strolled through Times Square and looked in a few shops before heading back to the hotel to go to the roof! The view from the top was amazing, looking right out at the Empire State building :D</p>

<p>Up early in the morning to do all things touristy!</p>
