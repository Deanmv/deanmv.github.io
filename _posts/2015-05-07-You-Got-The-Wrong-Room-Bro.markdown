Grabbed an Uber (taxi) into the centre of Denver today and got a Starbucks for breakfast (so we could use their WiFi). Took a stroll around and realised Denver is extremely dull at 9am... We then remembered the Zoo! Love a good zoo and this one was huge!

We spent almost 4 hours at the zoo wondering round, turns out American kids are crazy loud! Once the school trips had left we could enjoy the zoo in peace and even managed a selfie with the lions.

We got an Uber back to town and found a cocktail bar offering Champagne cocktails for $4 on their happy hour... day made! To top the day off, we went to the Cheesecake factory for dinner! Typically, we filled up on the dinner and couldn’t manage a cheesecake (although still ordered one for take out to have for breakfast).

Looking forward to lying down after a big meal, we headed back to the motel. Opened the door to find 3 men in our room! One of which said ‘you got the wrong room bro’... no, we definitely didn’t!!! Where the hell was our stuff?!!!!!! Panicking and running to the reception to ask what’s happened, they were just as confused but thankfully had our things. I full on panicked wondering where the hell my wedding dress was!!!!!!! The receptionist was kind enough to honour our booking (as it was their fault giving away our room!) and we managed to blag free WiFi too. 

Safe to say, we are heading out as early as possible to get away from this hotel. Long drive to Rushmore before staying in a (hopefully nicer) hotel in Rapid City tomorrow.
