Not going to lie, today dragged! Knowing we had nothing to see along the way and it’s part 1 of our drive to Chicago. 503.6 miles basically across one road! Thank goodness American cars have cruise control :D The first hour and a half was through snow! Who’d have thought it? It was SO heavy, made us look like tits driving in a Mustang when everyone in South Dakota had pick up trucks.

About 6 hours into the drive we spotted a sign of the Green Giant statue, 60ft high! Obviously, we had to stop and I needed a picture with it. No idea why it was there (Dean obviously stopped to read all the signs...).

We checked into yet another hotel and went for dinner at Applebees, it was amazing! Such nice food although midway through a burger slider I realised it had pineapple in (I’m allergic!), this honeymoon could get interesting :/
On the plus side, they played some classic music, Green Day and All American Rejects and the Margaritas were delicious!

We’re settled in for the night now watching trash US telly, Locked Up! Got obsessed with it a few years ago in Vegas :D
