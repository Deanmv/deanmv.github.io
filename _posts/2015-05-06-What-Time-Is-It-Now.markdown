Breakfast with a view.

Driving to The View Hotel lost us an hour due to them not in keeping with DST. We left at 8:30am and by 8:45am we gained the hour back which totally threw us, now it was 7:45am! Who the hell are we leaving so early?

We planned a long day ahead to save us a days driving tomorrow so we could explore Denver. Those that know me well enough know I’m a complete backseat driver, so to be in the 2nd day of driving we’ve done well to not yell at each other! After stopping to take a badass picture of the Mustang we continued ahead with the roof down (note to self... don’t have your hair down when the roof is off! SO many knots - Me, not Dean! :P).

Along the way, we booked a hotel just outside Denver for the next two nights. SO glad we’re with 3 and can use our phone as normal (Other phone providers are available... they’re just not as good). Then, the rain hit! Bloody hell does it rain here. This didn’t help my blisters when driving, I couldn’t have gripped harder to the steering wheel if I’d tried! Not to mention driving along the steepest cliff edges (Holz, you would have HATED it!). Somewhere across the morning we lost an hour again! I can’t keep up, too confused!

Next stop, Wendy’s! The waitress needed my name for the order so I said Lois and without fail she typed it... RIGHT! This is why I love the USA, they never look in horror when I say my name and hope I automatically start spelling it. After filling up with more petrol and Dean back at the wheel and just over 2 hours left of the drive, we drove through some snowy mountains. Dean tried to persuade me to let us stop and ski... it wasn’t happening - bossy wife. Along the route, we drove up 12,000ft and ended up driving through clouds and snow!

Our only complaint about the Mustang is the seats! After a few hours your back kills where the seat digs in. Looking forward to a days break tomorrow and some WALKING around. After checking into a hotel that I’m sure featured in Psycho, we grabbed some booze from the liquor store and settled in for the night watching the thunderstorm and hoping the Mustang doesn’t get nicked.
