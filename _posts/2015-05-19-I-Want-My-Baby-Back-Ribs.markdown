Yesterday was our last full day of what feels like the worlds longest honeymoon! In some ways, Vegas feels like months ago and in other ways it seems like just yesterday. We’ve no idea where we were on what days, some places have merged into one! It’s been the best holiday though.

3135.2 miles driven over 54 hours! Vegas, Utah, Denver, Rapid City, Albert Lea, Chicago, Richfield, Washington, Philadelphia and finally NYC! 10 different hotels, which meant 10 different places to nick all the toiletries :D My favourite, got the world of shampoo, conditioner and moisturiser. In a way, I’m looking forward to getting home, unpacking, doing all the washing, housework and picking up little Robbie (Cat) who we’ve been checking on the webcam daily!

Back to yesterday though, weather wasn’t great so we started the day shopping. On our way to Macys we found this little cupcake shop, I say little, the cupcakes definitely weren’t little! As I’d starved myself yesterday because I was unwell, I was SO hungry all day yesterday and ate everything in sight. We even found a KFC later on so HAD to have lunch there ;) Once the rain had cleared we bought our stars and sun tickets for Top Of The Rock! Dean then let me drool over all the diamonds in Tiffany’s :) He only did as the Apple store was next door and he wanted to drool over the Apple watches ;). We walked round my favourite store, F.A.O Schwartz which is closing next week to move to a cheaper location!

The sun finally picked up so we headed over to Central Park again. On the way over all the horses were lined up and everyone kept asking if we wanted a ride through central park. I know they are an iconic part of NYC, but I don’t think they should be around anymore. Especially on a very hot day like yesterday. None of the horses had water offered to them and the thought of them having to pull very heavy Americans around all day just didn’t seem fair.

We went back to the hotel to get ready for dinner and headed to a cocktail bar just next door to the hotel. I had a delicious champagne cocktail and Dean had Kracken and coke. We cancelled our reservation at The View for dinner, as we read many bad reviews and also found out it’s a set menu of 3 courses which neither of us wanted. So, instead we had TGI Fridays! I had my most random meal yet, steak, Mac & Cheese and Broccoli... yes, vegetables at last! The waitress in TGI ID’d us (which is fair enough as we think it’s 21 to have a drink with a meal in the US) but she said ‘I have to ID as you don’t look 40’... 40? They ’Think 40’ like the UK thinks 25! That’s taking it to the extreme, there’s no need to ID people that much older than 21.

After dinner, we stopped off for a drink at the Sixty Five bar on the 65th floor of Rockefeller. It was a very classy bar and people were a little snooty (it took 4 people to show us to a lift... completely unnecessary). Nevertheless, we enjoyed the most expensive drinks we’ll probably ever have at the best view we’ll probably ever see. The bar looked directly out at the Empire State which was lit up pink. Dean ordered a rum on the rocks to fit in, we both looked completely out of place when we pointed out how large the ice cube was! Honestly, it was huge, wouldn’t fit in our freezer tray! When it came to paying for the drinks, Dean wanted to look like a rich kid so he paid with a Benjamin ($100 bill). 

After the drinks, we made our way to the Top Of The Rock observation deck. The view was amazing, to see a 360 degree view of NYC lit up at night :) We’ve been up Rockefeller before but we haven’t gone in the daytime so we are looking forward to that this afternoon.

Our flight isn’t until 10:50pm US time, so we land around 10am Thursday morning. I’m hoping to get on the plane, listen to my Scott Mills podcasts and sleep the whole flight. We don’t have to check out until 12 today so we are taking it easy this morning, slowly packing :( and we will leave our things in the hotel and head back to Rockefeller and Central Park for the day.

No more blogs I’m afraid! Thanks for reading, hope you found them interesting :) Back to reality and we look forward to our reception Saturday. Of course, we won’t have anything to speak about as we’ve written the majority for you all the read!
