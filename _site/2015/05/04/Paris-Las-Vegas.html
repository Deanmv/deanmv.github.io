<p>Vegas Baby! So, we arrive amidst the big fight chaos and in a rush to get to the Marriage License Bureau we found ourselves stuck in traffic! Thankfully, we were there before they shut and got our license :)</p> 

<p>By morning, we hear there was a shooting at the hotel just next door... glad we didn’t attempt to go the MGM and watch the fight in their sports bar as it was 150$ just to get in to watch it on the TV’s!</p>

<p>By 11am we started getting ready for the big day! With some bubbly and beer for dutch courage we dolled up. At 1 o’clock the limo driver called to pick us up... no going back now.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the Shalimar Wedding Chapel we filled out paperwork and waited for the Minister after having some pictures taken. Just a short 3 minute ceremony and suddenly we are Mr and Mrs Vizer :) Everyone was lovely and it was perfect, not too much fuss as we aren’t ones for showing off! After getting taken back to the Paris hotel in the limo there was enough time for a quick gamble in our wedding gear before getting ready for dinner.</p>

<p>The Eiffel Tower Restaurant was fantastic and the staff were kind enough to give us the window seat over looking the Bellagio fountains and a free celebratory dessert :D (note to self: tell everyone we’ve just gotten married to get ALL THE FREEBIES).</p>

<p>Right, time to pack as we have an early start to pick up the car and drive to our first stop, The View hotel in Monument Valley! Mrs Vizer... xx</p>
