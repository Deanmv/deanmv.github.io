8 years ago today, Dean awkwardly asked me out over MSN to Jet - Are You Gunna Be My Girl? lyrics. Who’d have thought 8 years later we’d be home owners, married and driving across America! We’re still yet to have our first argument (as I’m always right ;) ).

To celebrate, we’re spending 6 hours in the car, lol. It’s all worth it though as we make our way to Washington. It’s nice to not have much walking to do today as my legs and hips are aching from yesterdays 8 miles! I’ve convinced Dean to let me buy a new pair of Uggs too as the shoes I bought with me are soaked and not particularly good to walk long distances in... what a shame, new Uggs!

In other news, we’re in the middle of making a video of our trip. We’re onto 3rd song so far, might be a long video :/ We planned to film us getting ready on our Wedding day but if we’re honest we both were crapping ourselves and completely forgot! Nevertheless, it’s still a good video so far with lots of random clips of things we’ve done/seen :)

Checking into yet another hotel, unpacking my dress again in the hope it doesn’t crease too much and off to grab yet more food! Up early to finish the drive to Washington DC :D
