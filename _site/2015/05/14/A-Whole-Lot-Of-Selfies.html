    <p>Spent the day being tourists in sunny sunny Washington DC. We walked past the White House again and over to the Washington Monument before heading over to the Lincoln Memorial. Where ever we seem to go at the moment we are surrounded by bus loads of school kids! FYI American kids are way more annoying than UK kids, they’re SO loud! As we made our way up the steps by the Lincoln Memorial, the amount of selfie sticks tripled. People appear to have no self awareness when it comes to taking selfies. Is it really the right time and place to take a selfie at the war memorial or with Lincoln in the background? Don’t get me started on the amount of effort some people go to prior to taking the selfie. I can’t wait for the day people look back and say ‘why the hell did we used to have our phones on a stick?’.</p>

<p>Anyway, I had my first Five Guys burger today! It was lush, easily the best burger I’ve had. Don’t know why Basingstoke doesn’t have one! Speaking of food, we’ve found a Nandos here so it’s only right we grab a ‘cheeky Nandos’ for dinner :)</p>

<p>We’ve walked a crazy amount today, so much so I needed a nap when we got back to the hotel. That and it’s been so hot I got a headache and being a typical Brit I got a little sunburnt :( </p>

<p>I’ve enjoyed Washington DC, not too crowded and much more of a relaxing city than NYC but I’ve found it a little too wealthy. We wanted to stop off for a drink on our way back from the memorials but everywhere seemed far too posh and expensive! Off to Philadelphia tomorrow morning, looking forward to seeing everything!</p>
