After being told by my Auntie Dilly that it would be rude not to have a Philly Cheesesteak, naturally we HAD to have one! Oh my goodness it was incredible :) Their record was a customer ate 13 ... THIRTEEN of them in an hour! Unbelievable.

We’d taken a nice stroll down an amazing few blocks, the houses were incredible and it was so quiet. Dean would happily move here in a heartbeat!

We strolled to the Magic Gardens. It’s such an amazing place. Took the guy 14 years to get it all set up and it is definitely as Mum described - ‘Like the shell house on acid’. It really was. The closer you looked at all the details the more you noticed some obscure objects, lots of phallic drawings and boobs.

We made our way to the Liberty Bell and Reading market. The queue was SO long for the bell and it was so hot we decided to just look at it through the window... Same thing, right? We sat and had several cocktails in a beer garden before heading off to Franklin Park. We melted as we played mini golf (Dean won :( ) and had milkshakes to cool off! It’s such a lovely place here, very relaxed, people seem nice and most importantly the food has been amazing. Easily the best place we’ve visited on this trip!

Whilst over at the Love sign and fountain, we saw a proposal! It was very sweet, everyone cheered and clapped (apart from Dean! Boring). Then back at the hotel we watched two weddings from our room! There’s love everywhere <3

From the fountain we walked what seemed like 10 miles to the Rocky steps... to find them closed! Looked like there was a graduation there this evening. We were gutted! Not only did we melt to get there, but we couldn’t run up the steps as planned!

Back to the hotel to freshen up before the game tonight. I am SO keen for hot dogs and nachos :D
