    <p>I have noticed (apart from when the Americans that can’t understand us) that complete strangers are much friendlier than Brits. 5 times in 2 weeks people have told me they love my hair! This rarely happens in the UK, Americans seem happier to give out compliments than us. Also, what’s with people just taking the piss out of the British accent straight away with their horrific impressions? I don’t go getting all American on their asses y’all.</p>

<p>Today we had a tiny drive (3 hours 10 mins) to Philadelphia! So excited to be here, seems like there is lots to do and so little time. We’re going to take it easy tonight and go out tomorrow morning and hope to see/do everything possible. Starting with the Magic Garden, if you haven’t heard of it have a Google. It looks incredible and reminds me of the Shell House in Bournemouth (only a few will know of this!).</p>

<p>We’re also planning on visiting the Liberty Bell as well as the Independence Hall and lots more! Annoyingly, a few things we’d planned to see don’t open for the year until next week! Never mind.</p>

<p>We’ve checked into an amazing hotel with a river view. On the drive over I searched for nearby places to eat and came across the Moshulu restaurant. It’s just a 5 minute walk away and is a restaurant on a Ship!</p>

<p>The meal was fantastic! Best meal so far, better than the food at the Paris hotel in Vegas! I had the tuna steak burger and Dean had swordfish for the first time. It was all SO good and we were lucky enough to get the sea view looking out. Always a laugh to get Dean out of his comfort zone and watch him try to act ‘posh’ yet he always ends up with food round his mouth :’)</p>

<p>Dean’s just booked us tickets to watch baseball tomorrow evening at the ball park. He’s very excited… I’m all for the hot dogs!</p>

<p>Todays Drive:<br />
135.1 Miles<br />
3 Hours 10 Minutes and 24 Seconds</p>
