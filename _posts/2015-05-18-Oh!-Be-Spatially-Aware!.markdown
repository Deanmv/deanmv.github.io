So Bubba Gump Shrimp... not my favourite anymore after an uncooked shrimp! Dean’s been a good husband and looked after me, it didn’t ruin the day too much but I did have to have a power nap this afternoon. Went to Ground Zero in the morning to see the place. Even though I saw the Twin Towers before 911, it still surprised me how large the fountains were that sit where they used to be. Sadly, the fountains weren’t on due to high winds but it was still amazing to see. So shocked to see all the names written around the edges, one in particular said the name of the woman and ‘her unborn child’ which was so upsetting. Yet, people still took smiling selfies with their ridiculous selfie sticks! Really not the time nor the place. The One World Trade Centre allows you to go up 103 floors to get a view of Ground Zero... typically, it didn’t open until May 29th 2015!

After my power nap we walked to Central Park. Easily the best part of NYC! I love how you can’t hear any of the traffic almost as soon as you’ve stepped into the park, not to mention all the dogs! I joked to Dean about how long it would take until we saw a Bernese Mountain Dog ... we saw 3 in such a short space of time! Gorgeous :D We spent hours in Central Park and still only made it half way, one day I will see the other side of the park! We’re hoping to go back Wednesday when the weather is meant to be a little nicer.

We walked back through Times Square and Dean grabbed a McDonalds, before doing some more site seeing then heading back to the hotel. I’m sitting typing this on the roof which we have all to ourselves! We’re waiting for the sun to set and the lights to start turning on :) <3 I do love this City!

Tomorrow night we’ve booked dinner at The View Restaurant which is NYCs only 360 Degree rotating restaurant. The views across NYC and the food is supposed to be amazing :D Can’t wait!
