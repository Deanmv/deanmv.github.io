    <p>Elvis has left the building… Today, we left Vegas! After picking up a badass MUSTANG and struggling to fit our suitcases in (we had to take the roof down to fit one in the back seat!) we hit the road. </p>

<p><img src="/images/mustang.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>En route to The View hotel in Monument Valley, roughly 6.5 hours away from Vegas, Dean started the drive. His little face lit up when the car started with a press of a button and all things gadgety appeared on the screen. We have our road trip Spotify playlist on the go to keep us entertained as well as the fantastic scenery. Honestly, why can’t the UK look more like the US? Views for miles and miles, empty roads, sunshine and us tourists not really sure what we’re doing! </p>

<p>First pit stop was a giggle, not only did we not know whether the car was Petrol or Diesel, but we couldn’t figure out the pump! Thankfully, the lady at the gas station was very helpful. Back on the road with me at the wheel… terrified! Who let me drive a basically new Mustang on the other side of the road and over a very sketchy looking bridge! After several hours we switched back, I gave myself blisters from gripping on to the steering wheel so tightly! Dean was glad to be driving again, he didn’t even want to let me have a turn… big kid.</p>

<p>So, we arrive in Monument Valley and it’s bloody raining! However, The View Hotel is insaaaane. We have a massive room with a microwave; which I mistook to be a TV… it’s been a long day! Our own private balcony which has an amazing view (see below).</p>

<p>Off to go get dinner overlooking this view and see if we can find any munch for the drive tomorrow! </p>

<p>Todays drive:<br />
399.6 Miles<br />
6 Hours 52 Minutes and 46 Seconds</p>
