Today we’re back in Mustang Mitch (Yeah, obviously we named him) en route to Mount Rushmore.

The towns nearby were incredible, one was called Pringle and only 157 people lived there! The drive up to Mount Rushmore was very scenic and reminded us of Yosemite. With much anticipation, I filmed the drive up the mountain waiting to see the sculptures and suddenly... there they were... tiny. I know it sounds stupid as they are MASSIVE but it didn’t seem it. It just wasn’t as impressive as I expected. Dean was annoyed I didn’t appreciate the scale of them and went off reading every single information sign... *yawn*.

There was an interesting film in the Theatre about the making of them, which I did find interesting as I didn’t realise it took so long to build! I am glad obviously that we went to see them :)

After driving to another hotel for the night (which seems like luxury compared to the hell hole we stayed in last night) we’re off for pizza! Tomorrow is part 1 of the drive to Chicago, doesn’t look like there is anything a long the way so don’t expect a post!
