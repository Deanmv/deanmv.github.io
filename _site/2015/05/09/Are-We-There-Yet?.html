    <p>Not going to lie, today dragged! Knowing we had nothing to see along the way and it’s part 1 of our drive to Chicago. 503.6 miles basically across one road! Thank goodness American cars have cruise control :D The first hour and a half was through snow! Who’d have thought it? It was SO heavy, made us look like tits driving in a Mustang when everyone in South Dakota had pick up trucks.</p>

<p><img src="/images/usDrive.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>About 6 hours into the drive we spotted a sign of the Green Giant statue, 60ft high! Obviously, we had to stop and I needed a picture with it. No idea why it was there (Dean obviously stopped to read all the signs…).</p>

<p><img src="/images/greenGiant.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We checked into yet another hotel and went for dinner at Applebees, it was amazing! Such nice food although midway through a burger slider I realised it had pineapple in (I’m allergic!), this honeymoon could get interesting :/
On the plus side, they played some classic music, Green Day and All American Rejects and the Margaritas were delicious!</p>

<p>We’re settled in for the night now watching trash US telly, Locked Up! Got obsessed with it a few years ago in Vegas :D</p>

<p>Todays drive:<br />
503.6 Miles<br />
6 Hours 53 Minutes and 08 Seconds</p>
