Last night, we had THE pizza from Man Vs Food. It was insane! Took an hour to cook (was well worth it) as it is 3” deep and FULL of deliciousness. We had the BBQ Beef pizza with peppers and onions. It was so filling I could only manage one slice... The waitress looked appalled at our failed attempt, however it made a good breakfast this morning! We also took a nice stroll round the park and discovered lots of art.

Today... Dean had his first coffee! I say coffee, it was a caffe mocha but it was enough to have him buzzing ;) We whizzed round the Field Natural History Museum before visiting the Aquarium. We saw the worlds most complete T Rex dinosaur which was huge, just her (they’ve named it Sue after the lady that discovered it) skull weighed 600lbs!

The aquarium was huge! We got to watch a ‘show’ which was really good with Dolphins showing off their skills. Although, I found the rave music and lighting a little unnecessary. When we left to walk back to the hotel we got caught in the storm! We were soaked and along the way we found someones wallet. After finding a camera at Mount Rushmore and being good people by handing it in, we thought we’d do the same with the wallet... Turns out no one wanted to help! After asking 3 different people we managed to leave it with a reluctant security guard at the college the guy goes to (found a little info in the wallet - we also tried to search him on Facebook first!). 

On to the Willis tower and the Sky Deck. Dean has been excited to walk out on the glass platform... me, not so much! We eventually got to the front of the queue and walked out on the platform. It wasn’t as scary as I’d imagined, but I didn’t want to stay for long!

We’d walked so much today that we’d built up an appetite for dinner! We stumbled across Noodles & Company and oh my god was it a good find :D So cheap but all fresh and cooked to order. We need places like this in the UK!

Tomorrow, we start the drive to Washington and are staying the night in Richfield. Turns out the hotels get more and more expensive the further across we are driving! :/
