    <p>After getting almost no sleep due to the people next door coughing/choking all night and slamming doors, we left early to head to Washington DC! Accidentally missed breakfast so settled for Krispy Kreme doughnuts and a LOT of Skittles :D Balanced diet of course. Don’t think we’ve had/seen any fruit and veg the whole time we’ve been here! Actually that’s a lie, Dean had lettuce and tomatoes in his Subway this afternoon… that counts, right?</p>

<p>It’s getting frustrating how many Americans don’t seem to be able to understand us. Yes, we phrase things slightly differently but you speak OUR language! We keep having to repeat ourselves then giving up and phrasing differently (i.e. dumbing down) for the Americans to understand ;) Dean was told he sounded Canadian today and when Dean corrected him the guy said ‘If you’d thrown an ‘aye’ in every now and then I’d have thought you were Canadian for sure!’ :’)</p>

<p>SUCCESS! My Wedding dress still fits after a week and a half of American food! Only one more week to go, fingers crossed it’ll still fit! :) Speaking of food, we went out for delicious Asian food tonight. Our waiter was very skinny (clearly never eaten Asian food in his life) but the food was delicious!!</p>

<p>We needed a walk after the big dinner so leisurely strolled to the White House (as you do). Something seemed to be going on as there were a lot of Police and the whole park was taped off. Eventually, they opened the park again and we were lead down to the White House by Secret Service on our own little tour :D Didn’t spot Barack though… let down.</p>

<p>We then had drinks at the bar in the hotel and got chatting to the locals. Turns out the man we were chatting to casually lived in Vegas for tax avoidance purposes (who tells strangers this?!) and the barmaid watches Top Gear and ‘Ello ‘Ello… She was lovely and gave us two free drinks as it’s our honeymoon, clearly it does pay off telling people!</p>
