    <p>Today was a big day… Chicago!! We’ve both been looking forward to getting here so we set off early (thanks to a man and his noisy barking dog outside our hotel room) and hit the road. I started the drive so Dean could take over when it came to driving through Chicago. </p>

<p>America seems to have a crazy amount of billboards, like a dangerous amount when you should be concentrating on driving. We drove past a sign for ‘Amish Ovens’ which confused me as I didn’t think they could have ovens… Dean just laughed at me, obviously.</p>

<p>We stopped off at McDonalds for lunch… it was the strangest McDonalds I’ve ever seen! Set in a winter ski lodge basically with stuffed animals everywhere and people sitting around an un-lit fire eating McDonalds. Kids wandering in swimming costumes and a games room… It didn’t quite add up.</p>

<p>Then came the final part of the trip to Chicago! Traffic began to build along with the amount of tolls, we went through 4! Why not just charge more at one? I was a classic Brit and gave the wrong coins as no matter how many times we’ve visited the US I still can’t tell what coin is what.</p>

<p>Eventually we saw the foggy Chicago skyline, we’re here! Can’t wait to look around this city :D We drove our Mustang to the valet parking like the ‘ballers’ we are (according to Dean) and had our luggage taken to our room (seriously, what have we become?). Tonight, we’ll explore and eat deep pan Chicago pizza! Hoping to find the place that featured on Man Vs Food :D * must remember I still need to fit into my wedding dress for the 23rd! *</p>
