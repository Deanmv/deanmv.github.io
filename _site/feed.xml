        <title>I Want My Baby Back Ribs!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was our last full day of what feels like the worlds longest honeymoon! In some ways, Vegas feels like months ago and in other ways it seems like just yesterday. We’ve no idea where we were on what days, some places have merged into one! It’s been the best holiday though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3135.2 miles driven over 54 hours! Vegas, Utah, Denver, Rapid City, Albert Lea, Chicago, Richfield, Washington, Philadelphia and finally NYC! 10 different hotels, which meant 10 different places to nick all the toiletries :D My favourite, got the world of shampoo, conditioner and moisturiser. In a way, I’m looking forward to getting home, unpacking, doing all the washing, housework and picking up little Robbie (Cat) who we’ve been checking on the webcam daily!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to yesterday though, weather wasn’t great so we started the day shopping. On our way to Macys we found this little cupcake shop, I say little, the cupcakes definitely weren’t little! As I’d starved myself yesterday because I was unwell, I was SO hungry all day yesterday and ate everything in sight. We even found a KFC later on so HAD to have lunch there ;) Once the rain had cleared we bought our stars and sun tickets for Top Of The Rock! Dean then let me drool over all the diamonds in Tiffany’s :) He only did as the Apple store was next door and he wanted to drool over the Apple watches ;). We walked round my favourite store, F.A.O Schwartz which is closing next week to move to a cheaper location! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Cupcake.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun finally picked up so we headed over to Central Park again. On the way over all the horses were lined up and everyone kept asking if we wanted a ride through central park. I know they are an iconic part of NYC, but I don’t think they should be around anymore. Especially on a very hot day like yesterday. None of the horses had water offered to them and the thought of them having to pull very heavy Americans around all day just didn’t seem fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Us.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went back to the hotel to get ready for dinner and headed to a cocktail bar just next door to the hotel. I had a delicious champagne cocktail and Dean had Kracken and coke. We cancelled our reservation at The View for dinner, as we read many bad reviews and also found out it’s a set menu of 3 courses which neither of us wanted. So, instead we had TGI Fridays! I had my most random meal yet, steak, Mac &amp;amp; Cheese and Broccoli… yes, vegetables at last! The waitress in TGI ID’d us (which is fair enough as we think it’s 21 to have a drink with a meal in the US) but she said ‘I have to ID as you don’t look 40’… 40? They ’Think 40’ like the UK thinks 25! That’s taking it to the extreme, there’s no need to ID people that much older than 21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/MacNCheese.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner, we stopped off for a drink at the Sixty Five bar on the 65th floor of Rockefeller. It was a very classy bar and people were a little snooty (it took 4 people to show us to a lift… completely unnecessary). Nevertheless, we enjoyed the most expensive drinks we’ll probably ever have at the best view we’ll probably ever see. The bar looked directly out at the Empire State which was lit up pink. Dean ordered a rum on the rocks to fit in, we both looked completely out of place when we pointed out how large the ice cube was! Honestly, it was huge, wouldn’t fit in our freezer tray! When it came to paying for the drinks, Dean wanted to look like a rich kid so he paid with a Benjamin ($100 bill). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the drinks, we made our way to the Top Of The Rock observation deck. The view was amazing, to see a 360 degree view of NYC lit up at night :) We’ve been up Rockefeller before but we haven’t gone in the daytime so we are looking forward to that this afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Topoftherock.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our flight isn’t until 10:50pm US time, so we land around 10am Thursday morning. I’m hoping to get on the plane, listen to my Scott Mills podcasts and sleep the whole flight. We don’t have to check out until 12 today so we are taking it easy this morning, slowly packing :( and we will leave our things in the hotel and head back to Rockefeller and Central Park for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No more blogs I’m afraid! Thanks for reading, hope you found them interesting :) Back to reality and we look forward to our reception Saturday. Of course, we won’t have anything to speak about as we’ve written the majority for you all the read!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Oh! Be Spatially Aware!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So Bubba Gump Shrimp… not my favourite anymore after an uncooked shrimp! Dean’s been a good husband and looked after me, it didn’t ruin the day too much but I did have to have a power nap this afternoon. Went to Ground Zero in the morning to see the place. Even though I saw the Twin Towers before 911, it still surprised me how large the fountains were that sit where they used to be. Sadly, the fountains weren’t on due to high winds but it was still amazing to see. So shocked to see all the names written around the edges, one in particular said the name of the woman and ‘her unborn child’ which was so upsetting. Yet, people still took smiling selfies with their ridiculous selfie sticks! Really not the time nor the place. The One World Trade Centre allows you to go up 103 floors to get a view of Ground Zero… typically, it didn’t open until May 29th 2015! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Groundzero.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my power nap we walked to Central Park. Easily the best part of NYC! I love how you can’t hear any of the traffic almost as soon as you’ve stepped into the park, not to mention all the dogs! I joked to Dean about how long it would take until we saw a Bernese Mountain Dog … we saw 3 in such a short space of time! Gorgeous :D We spent hours in Central Park and still only made it half way, one day I will see the other side of the park! We’re hoping to go back Wednesday when the weather is meant to be a little nicer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Timesquare.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked back through Times Square and Dean grabbed a McDonalds, before doing some more site seeing then heading back to the hotel. I’m sitting typing this on the roof which we have all to ourselves! We’re waiting for the sun to set and the lights to start turning on :) &amp;lt;3 I do love this City!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow night we’ve booked dinner at The View Restaurant which is NYCs only 360 Degree rotating restaurant. The views across NYC and the food is supposed to be amazing :D Can’t wait!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Stop Flailing So Near My Nachos</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun ddddun dun dun! Didn’t hear that classic tune once at the baseball. It was great fun though, minus the horrific thunderstorm that almost called off the game. Found someones phone (very wet) and like the good people we are we handed it to him. I ate several hot dogs and shared cheesesteak nachos :D One thing I did notice is that the Americans seem to have limited attention span. Literally after one bat, they’re up again getting more food, drinks, swapping seats and being generally annoying. One family in front of us came with their two sons and a baby that couldn’t have been more than a week old!! She was tiny! Amazingly, she slept through the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning we left Philly and drove to JFK to hand back Mitch :( It was a sad time, we’d gotten so used to driving Mitch and being a trusty Ford he was a good car to drive! Dean’s wanting to buy a new one for our dog… which we both know won’t fit in a Mustang. After a little stress handing the car back, sorting paperwork and an hour and a half drive to in the taxi through traffic, we were finally here! The Cassa hotel is a very new hotel and it’s in a good spot for us. It’s walking distance to Times Square and it has a two roof top terraces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Timessquare.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to Bubba Gump shrimp for dinner and only had a short wait considering it was 7pm and a weekend in Times Square. We had cocktails and a lush dinner :) The waiter came round and quizzed us on our Forrest Gump knowledge, he was disappointed to hear I’d never seen it!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/BG.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/BG2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner we strolled through Times Square and looked in a few shops before heading back to the hotel to go to the roof! The view from the top was amazing, looking right out at the Empire State building :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Roof.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Roof2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up early in the morning to do all things touristy!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Philly Cheesesteaks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After being told by my Auntie Dilly that it would be rude not to have a Philly Cheesesteak, naturally we HAD to have one! Oh my goodness it was incredible :) Their record was a customer ate 13 … THIRTEEN of them in an hour! Unbelievable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Phillycheesesteak.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d taken a nice stroll down an amazing few blocks, the houses were incredible and it was so quiet. Dean would happily move here in a heartbeat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Street.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We strolled to the Magic Gardens. It’s such an amazing place. Took the guy 14 years to get it all set up and it is definitely as Mum described - ‘Like the shell house on acid’. It really was. The closer you looked at all the details the more you noticed some obscure objects, lots of phallic drawings and boobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Magicgarden.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Magicgardens.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made our way to the Liberty Bell and Reading market. The queue was SO long for the bell and it was so hot we decided to just look at it through the window… Same thing, right? We sat and had several cocktails in a beer garden before heading off to Franklin Park. We melted as we played mini golf (Dean won :( ) and had milkshakes to cool off! It’s such a lovely place here, very relaxed, people seem nice and most importantly the food has been amazing. Easily the best place we’ve visited on this trip!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst over at the Love sign and fountain, we saw a proposal! It was very sweet, everyone cheered and clapped (apart from Dean! Boring). Then back at the hotel we watched two weddings from our room! There’s love everywhere &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Love.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the fountain we walked what seemed like 10 miles to the Rocky steps… to find them closed! Looked like there was a graduation there this evening. We were gutted! Not only did we melt to get there, but we couldn’t run up the steps as planned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the hotel to freshen up before the game tonight. I am SO keen for hot dogs and nachos :D&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I Love Your Hair</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have noticed (apart from when the Americans that can’t understand us) that complete strangers are much friendlier than Brits. 5 times in 2 weeks people have told me they love my hair! This rarely happens in the UK, Americans seem happier to give out compliments than us. Also, what’s with people just taking the piss out of the British accent straight away with their horrific impressions? I don’t go getting all American on their asses y’all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we had a tiny drive (3 hours 10 mins) to Philadelphia! So excited to be here, seems like there is lots to do and so little time. We’re going to take it easy tonight and go out tomorrow morning and hope to see/do everything possible. Starting with the Magic Garden, if you haven’t heard of it have a Google. It looks incredible and reminds me of the Shell House in Bournemouth (only a few will know of this!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also planning on visiting the Liberty Bell as well as the Independence Hall and lots more! Annoyingly, a few things we’d planned to see don’t open for the year until next week! Never mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/View.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve checked into an amazing hotel with a river view. On the drive over I searched for nearby places to eat and came across the Moshulu restaurant. It’s just a 5 minute walk away and is a restaurant on a Ship!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/boat.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meal was fantastic! Best meal so far, better than the food at the Paris hotel in Vegas! I had the tuna steak burger and Dean had swordfish for the first time. It was all SO good and we were lucky enough to get the sea view looking out. Always a laugh to get Dean out of his comfort zone and watch him try to act ‘posh’ yet he always ends up with food round his mouth :’)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dean’s just booked us tickets to watch baseball tomorrow evening at the ball park. He’s very excited… I’m all for the hot dogs!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Whole Lot Of Selfies</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Spent the day being tourists in sunny sunny Washington DC. We walked past the White House again and over to the Washington Monument before heading over to the Lincoln Memorial. Where ever we seem to go at the moment we are surrounded by bus loads of school kids! FYI American kids are way more annoying than UK kids, they’re SO loud! As we made our way up the steps by the Lincoln Memorial, the amount of selfie sticks tripled. People appear to have no self awareness when it comes to taking selfies. Is it really the right time and place to take a selfie at the war memorial or with Lincoln in the background? Don’t get me started on the amount of effort some people go to prior to taking the selfie. I can’t wait for the day people look back and say ‘why the hell did we used to have our phones on a stick?’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Monument.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Lincoln.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I had my first Five Guys burger today! It was lush, easily the best burger I’ve had. Don’t know why Basingstoke doesn’t have one! Speaking of food, we’ve found a Nandos here so it’s only right we grab a ‘cheeky Nandos’ for dinner :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve walked a crazy amount today, so much so I needed a nap when we got back to the hotel. That and it’s been so hot I got a headache and being a typical Brit I got a little sunburnt :( &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve enjoyed Washington DC, not too crowded and much more of a relaxing city than NYC but I’ve found it a little too wealthy. We wanted to stop off for a drink on our way back from the memorials but everywhere seemed far too posh and expensive! Off to Philadelphia tomorrow morning, looking forward to seeing everything!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Two Krispy Kremes And A Whole Lot Of Skittles</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After getting almost no sleep due to the people next door coughing/choking all night and slamming doors, we left early to head to Washington DC! Accidentally missed breakfast so settled for Krispy Kreme doughnuts and a LOT of Skittles :D Balanced diet of course. Don’t think we’ve had/seen any fruit and veg the whole time we’ve been here! Actually that’s a lie, Dean had lettuce and tomatoes in his Subway this afternoon… that counts, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s getting frustrating how many Americans don’t seem to be able to understand us. Yes, we phrase things slightly differently but you speak OUR language! We keep having to repeat ourselves then giving up and phrasing differently (i.e. dumbing down) for the Americans to understand ;) Dean was told he sounded Canadian today and when Dean corrected him the guy said ‘If you’d thrown an ‘aye’ in every now and then I’d have thought you were Canadian for sure!’ :’)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SUCCESS! My Wedding dress still fits after a week and a half of American food! Only one more week to go, fingers crossed it’ll still fit! :) Speaking of food, we went out for delicious Asian food tonight. Our waiter was very skinny (clearly never eaten Asian food in his life) but the food was delicious!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Food.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Food2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We needed a walk after the big dinner so leisurely strolled to the White House (as you do). Something seemed to be going on as there were a lot of Police and the whole park was taped off. Eventually, they opened the park again and we were lead down to the White House by Secret Service on our own little tour :D Didn’t spot Barack though… let down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Whitehouse.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then had drinks at the bar in the hotel and got chatting to the locals. Turns out the man we were chatting to casually lived in Vegas for tax avoidance purposes (who tells strangers this?!) and the barmaid watches Top Gear and ‘Ello ‘Ello… She was lovely and gave us two free drinks as it’s our honeymoon, clearly it does pay off telling people!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Is That Girl Stretching In Burger King?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;8 years ago today, Dean awkwardly asked me out over MSN to Jet - Are You Gunna Be My Girl? lyrics. Who’d have thought 8 years later we’d be home owners, married and driving across America! We’re still yet to have our first argument (as I’m always right ;) ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/old.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate, we’re spending 6 hours in the car, lol. It’s all worth it though as we make our way to Washington. It’s nice to not have much walking to do today as my legs and hips are aching from yesterdays 8 miles! I’ve convinced Dean to let me buy a new pair of Uggs too as the shoes I bought with me are soaked and not particularly good to walk long distances in… what a shame, new Uggs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, we’re in the middle of making a video of our trip. We’re onto 3rd song so far, might be a long video :/ We planned to film us getting ready on our Wedding day but if we’re honest we both were crapping ourselves and completely forgot! Nevertheless, it’s still a good video so far with lots of random clips of things we’ve done/seen :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checking into yet another hotel, unpacking my dress again in the hope it doesn’t crease too much and off to grab yet more food! Up early to finish the drive to Washington DC :D&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Chicago</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night, we had THE pizza from Man Vs Food. It was insane! Took an hour to cook (was well worth it) as it is 3” deep and FULL of deliciousness. We had the BBQ Beef pizza with peppers and onions. It was so filling I could only manage one slice… The waitress looked appalled at our failed attempt, however it made a good breakfast this morning! We also took a nice stroll round the park and discovered lots of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today… Dean had his first coffee! I say coffee, it was a caffe mocha but it was enough to have him buzzing ;) We whizzed round the Field Natural History Museum before visiting the Aquarium. We saw the worlds most complete T Rex dinosaur which was huge, just her (they’ve named it Sue after the lady that discovered it) skull weighed 600lbs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aquarium was huge! We got to watch a ‘show’ which was really good with Dolphins showing off their skills. Although, I found the rave music and lighting a little unnecessary. When we left to walk back to the hotel we got caught in the storm! We were soaked and along the way we found someones wallet. After finding a camera at Mount Rushmore and being good people by handing it in, we thought we’d do the same with the wallet… Turns out no one wanted to help! After asking 3 different people we managed to leave it with a reluctant security guard at the college the guy goes to (found a little info in the wallet - we also tried to search him on Facebook first!). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On to the Willis tower and the Sky Deck. Dean has been excited to walk out on the glass platform… me, not so much! We eventually got to the front of the queue and walked out on the platform. It wasn’t as scary as I’d imagined, but I didn’t want to stay for long! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/skyDeck.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d walked so much today that we’d built up an appetite for dinner! We stumbled across Noodles &amp;amp; Company and oh my god was it a good find :D So cheap but all fresh and cooked to order. We need places like this in the UK!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, we start the drive to Washington and are staying the night in Richfield. Turns out the hotels get more and more expensive the further across we are driving! :/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Todays walking:&lt;br /&gt;
8 Miles&lt;br /&gt;
3 Hours 36 Minutes&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Do The Amish Have Ovens?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was a big day… Chicago!! We’ve both been looking forward to getting here so we set off early (thanks to a man and his noisy barking dog outside our hotel room) and hit the road. I started the drive so Dean could take over when it came to driving through Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America seems to have a crazy amount of billboards, like a dangerous amount when you should be concentrating on driving. We drove past a sign for ‘Amish Ovens’ which confused me as I didn’t think they could have ovens… Dean just laughed at me, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped off at McDonalds for lunch… it was the strangest McDonalds I’ve ever seen! Set in a winter ski lodge basically with stuffed animals everywhere and people sitting around an un-lit fire eating McDonalds. Kids wandering in swimming costumes and a games room… It didn’t quite add up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came the final part of the trip to Chicago! Traffic began to build along with the amount of tolls, we went through 4! Why not just charge more at one? I was a classic Brit and gave the wrong coins as no matter how many times we’ve visited the US I still can’t tell what coin is what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cloudyChicago.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we saw the foggy Chicago skyline, we’re here! Can’t wait to look around this city :D We drove our Mustang to the valet parking like the ‘ballers’ we are (according to Dean) and had our luggage taken to our room (seriously, what have we become?). Tonight, we’ll explore and eat deep pan Chicago pizza! Hoping to find the place that featured on Man Vs Food :D * must remember I still need to fit into my wedding dress for the 23rd! *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/chicagoHotelView.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Todays drive:&lt;br /&gt;
405 Miles&lt;br /&gt;
6 Hours 25 Minutes and 08 Seconds&lt;/p&gt;
